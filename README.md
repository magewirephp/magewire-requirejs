[Magewire](https://github.com/magewirephp/magewire) by default is meant as a Hyva Themes first extension. This means it
will only work on Hyva based themes out of the box and will not work on e.g. Luma or Blank based Magento 2 themes
(RequireJS dependend themes).

Because most developers want to work with a more modern and fun tech-stack doesn't mean I forgot all those die-hards
who still work with the original Magento frontend. **Magewire is made compatible via this so-called compatibility extension**.

## Installation
```
composer require magewirephp/magewire-requirejs
```

## Magewire examples
The ```magewirephp/magewire-examples``` extension will work in some extent but is not fully functional since most of
it's features are written with AlpineJS required.
